<h3>Success is largely a matter of holding on after others have let go!</h3>
<ul>
<li>A year from now you may wish you had started today.</li>
<li>The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.</li>
<li>Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day-in and day-out.</li>
<li>I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.</li>
<li>If people did not do silly things, nothing intelligent would ever get done.</li>
<li>Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t ever play yourself. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, I’m just getting started. <a href="https://tielabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surround yourself with angels</a>, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. I’m up to something. They don’t want us to win. Mogul talk. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Great things in business are never done by one person. They&#8217;re done by a team of people. <cite>Steve Jobs</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast.</p>
<p>Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. Another one. It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough? The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there.</p>

<li>Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.</li>
